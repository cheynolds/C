/*
Add file IO to program 4. Create a plain-text file that will store employee information from the program code.
The program will have the ability to load the array with the data from the file.
When the user chooses to load from a file, ask for the name of the file, then load the data into the employee array. 
If they choose keyboard, load the data as was done previously. Note that the application is going to want to 
use the folder where the .exe file is located when looking for the file, unless we type in a full or relative path. 
Using the debug folder is fine for our purposes. Once the data is loaded into our array, either from an already 
existing file, or from keyboard input, we’ll then have our menu from the previous assignment. Before the
program exits, you will need to ask for the name of the file to save the data to. If we loaded from a file
already, we’ll use the same file and overwrite the contents. We don’t need to cover deleting employee data. 
We can also assume that we only need to handle at most 10 employees worth of data.
