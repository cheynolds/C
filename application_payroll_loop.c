/*
Payroll 2.0

Update the first program.

Use for loops to process the data for 5 employees.
One loop to load the data
One loop to print the output. 
In for loops, if any of the entered fields are â€“1, break out of the loop immediately after getting -1
Update the output as shown in the sample data.
Use arrays to store the user input. 
 

The program logic will first load all of the data, until the user enters the max number of records, or they input -1 for one of the fields. After the data is loaded, it will then be processed and output generated.

Example 

Enter name: Glenn

Enter hourly rate: 2.00

Enter hours worked: 50

 

Enter name: Stephanie

Enter hourly rate: 25.00

Enter hours worked: 50

 

Enter name: -1

 

Pay to: Glenn

Hours worked:                50.0

Hourly rate:                 $    2.00

Gross pay:                  $110.00

Base pay:                   $  80.00

Overtime pay:             $  30.00

Taxes paid:                 $  22.00

Net pay:                      $  88.00
